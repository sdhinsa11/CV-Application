# React Resume Project

This project was made in part of the Odins Project curriculum. I created my first ever react app, utilizing components, states and more! I hope you enjoy this project! I will still be editing it over the next little bit! It is also deployed here: https://resubuild.netlify.app/. Check it out!1
